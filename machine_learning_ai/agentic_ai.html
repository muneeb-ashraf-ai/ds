            <h2>Autonomous Agents</h2>
            <p>Autonomous agents are intelligent systems capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals without continuous human intervention. These agents combine sensing, reasoning, and acting capabilities to operate independently in dynamic environments.</p>
            
            <h2>Multi-Agent Systems</h2>
            <p>Multi-agent systems involve multiple autonomous agents working together, competing, or negotiating to solve complex problems. These systems demonstrate emergent behaviors that arise from the interactions between individual agents.</p>
            
            <h2>Planning and Reasoning</h2>
            <p>Agentic AI systems employ sophisticated planning algorithms and reasoning mechanisms to achieve their objectives. This includes goal decomposition, action planning, and adaptive behavior based on environmental feedback.</p>
            
            <h2>Applications in Real World</h2>
            <p>Agentic AI finds applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, smart grid management, financial trading systems, and collaborative AI assistants that can work together to solve complex problems.</p>
