        <div class="content">
            <p>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. At its core, machine learning involves developing algorithms that can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">History of Machine Learning</button>
        <div class="content">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1950s:</strong> The term "Machine Learning" is coined by Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>1960s-1970s:</strong> Early ML models like the Perceptron are developed, laying the groundwork for neural networks.</li>
                <li><strong>1980s:</strong> The field experiences a resurgence with the invention of backpropagation, a key algorithm for training neural networks.</li>
                <li><strong>1990s:</strong> The focus shifts to statistical learning methods, with the rise of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and decision trees.</li>
                <li><strong>2000s:</strong> The advent of large datasets and increased computational power fuels the growth of complex models.</li>
                <li><strong>2010s-Present:</strong> Deep Learning, a subset of ML, achieves state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and more.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Types of Machine Learning</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Machine learning is broadly categorized into three main types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The model is trained on labeled data, meaning each data point is tagged with a correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen data.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The model is trained on unlabeled data and attempts to find patterns and structures on its own. Common tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The model learns by interacting with an environment. It receives rewards or penalties for its actions and learns to choose actions that maximize the cumulative reward.</li>
            </ul>
